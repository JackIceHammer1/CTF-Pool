Lots of fun here. Shocker I used so much chem. Lets get into it.

The first 3 values are electron configurations, and decrypt into:
1: phosphorus
2: sulfur
3: carbon

The 4th value is a little more fun. What I'm getting at is half-life calculation. When you calculate the half life using the 28.62 for the age in years and 20% for the activity, you get a half-life of 12.32 years. An isotop of HYDROGEN has a half like of 12.32 years
 
So,
1: p
2: s 
3: c 
4: h

These are used in the first level on encryption, which is the mexican army cipher (vsauce hint). You need the position of the 4 wheels in order for this to work. The positions are the p, s, c, h.

When decrypted it yields: Property of Nerv TFVEKISXYZMTEAI

The TFVEKISXYZMTEAI is the Atbash cipher (point of the hebrew hint)

That decrypts to GUEVPRHCBANGVZR

That is simiply ROT-13, which decrypts into the flag "THRICEUPONATIME"
