Welcome back! After seeing My Cool Website and my new MBA, my boss David promoted me to VP of Northeastern Sales. It's been a pretty wild ride.
My big plan is to start a website to increase sales! Unfortunately, I don't know HTML; can you help me? I attached an image for reference.

You don't need to add any framework or import a style or JS. Unfortunately, the website editor i'm using cannot save your code, so i reccomend backing it up somewhere. If you are asked
to add multiple elements in one direction, add them in order. Make sure there are no extra line breaks, no spaces before or after elements; if you are having problems, ask!

ex:
<button type="button">I am a button.</button>

1. Add a heading element with a size of 1 that reads, "Dunder Mifflin Infinity"

2. Create 3 buttons using <a> that direct to "/home.html", "/shop.html", and "/login.html". These pages do not exist (yet)(TBD)

3. Add a heading element with a size of 2 that reads, "Welcome to Dunder Mifflin Infinity!"

4. Insert an image element with the name "logo.png"

5. Add a heading element with a size of 3 that reads, "Dwights Paper Picks:"

6. Insert 3 image elements that refer to "glossystock.jpg", "legalpaper.jpg", "collegeruled.png"

7. Add a header element of 6 that reads: "Ⓒ 2000-2015 <br> Talk to a representative: (443)-797-3842"

8. Thanks for your help! I'll take it from here.
