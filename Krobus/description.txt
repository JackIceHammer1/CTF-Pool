Farmer,

While scouring the sewers, I came across an old tablet that I hypothesize contains a segment of the language spoken by Krobus and his people. However, none of my magic arts have been able to tell me what exactly the tablet says. It must be the magic concentration, not me. KEYWORD, NOT ME. I understand you are an accomplished farmer, and may have FAIR knowledge on bigrams, which I heavily suspect is in play here. I would appreciate if you could take a crack at decrypting the tablet's message.

My thanks,
M. Rasmodius
