<p>Welcome to James Keller's Amazing Baking recipes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<P>Scenario: I am hiding this website and its files from google's webcrawlers because this website has all my baking recipes on it, I would hate for them to index my website and files to make a cooking book off of my recipes so I left them some instructions in a text file, can you find that file? </p>
<p> the answer will look like this: "lbctf{xxxxxxxxx}" </p>
