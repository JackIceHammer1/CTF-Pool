Welcome to the town of Ignatium. You are now in the care of Steve the wizard. He has but one question for you. What is the best way to keep 7 horses and 3 sheep from living in close proximity? Furthermore, make sure that these said animals do not endager the lives of the three lions that we have next door. Also, I am 7000 years old, only to be outlived by the founder of our town himself. Regardless, what is the shape of the sun?
