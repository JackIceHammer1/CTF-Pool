    <h1><br>
        In search of spells, I tread the ancient halls,<br>
        Beneath the moon's dim glow, where darkness calls.<br>
        Alas, no incantation yet I've found,<br>
        To match the strength with which my will is bound.
        <br><br>
        The Alabaster Lord, with wisdom deep,<br>
        His magic's secrets in his chambers keep.<br>
        Yet even he, with all his mystic lore,<br>
        Lacks a spell that can my power restore.
        <br><br>
        I stand alone, amidst the shadows drear,<br>
        Yearning for magic that will draw near.<br>
        But until that day, I'll wield my might,<br>
        And brave the darkness with relentless fight.
