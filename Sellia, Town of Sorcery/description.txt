Leonard, my faithful steed, grows weary, his strength waning beneath my weight. Thus, I journey to Sellia, seeking audience with an Alabaster Lord, master of gravitational magic. It is my hope that through this arcane art, I might restore Leonard's vigor and reclaim the power to ride him once more, perhaps even to stem the celestial tide. Yet, in this pursuit, I require a spell befitting my prowess, one that shall match the strength of my will.
