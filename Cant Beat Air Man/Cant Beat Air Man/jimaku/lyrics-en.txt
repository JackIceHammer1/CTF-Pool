[Verse 1]
I've noticed that every time I play
Around that same spot
That I always die at the same place

Never giving up, I challenge the disappearing footholds but soon fall below!

[Hook]
If I had Item #2 I could easily reach the other side, but no matter what, however many times I try...

[Chorus]
I cannot defeat Airman!
No matter how many times I try, I cannot avoid that tornado!
I get behind him and fire repeatedly, but the wind hurls me back regardless. I tried to attempt the Time Barrage glitch too, but against the tornado it is meaningless! Thus, for the sake of absolute victory
Next time I will only take the E-Tank at the very last moment

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]

When I notice I've only got a little bit of life
That's when I always use the E-Tank
Never giving up, I pursue the road to Airman
But soon I lose my remaining lives

[Hook]
If I had Leaf Shield, Airman would be a breeze to defeat, but
No matter what, however many times I try...

[Chorus]
I cannot defeat Woodman!
No matter how many times I try
I cannot dodge the falling leaves
I get behind him and step backwards
But despite that, he always closes the distance
I tried to attempt the Time Barrage glitch, too
But I cannot dodge his jump!
Thus, for the sake of absolute victory
Next time, I will only take the E-Tank at the very last moment
