    What is a website?
</h2>
<p style="font-size: 150%">
    A website is a set of files accessible from the internet. 
    A website is typically hosted by a webserver that contains the DNS address and the files used to host the website. 
    DNS stands for Domain Same System and is used to resolve IP addresses to a domain.
    An IP address is a set of numbers associated with a router, server, or workstation.

    Challenge

    Welcome to this demo website! The purpose of this website is to learn how to browse directories.<br>
    Every website has a url that displays the filepath of the current page you are on. <br> 
    If you look at the url, you will notice it ends with "/index.html". This is the name of the file that you are currently viewing. <br>
    Now, click on the url and remove "index.html" and replace it with "site.html" and hit enter. I'll see you there!
