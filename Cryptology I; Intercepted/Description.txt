You have intercepted an encoded message. It is believed to be a letter hastily written by your sworn enemy, Dr. E. Villman, to one of his accomplices. The code appears to be English-based. Your boss, Mr. Chris Tology, has asked you to decode the message by all means necessary. The methods learned in the intro challenge “Cryptology 101“ may be of use to you (Although you can certainly solve it using your own methods as well).

A second, shorter message was also intercepted, and appears to be using the same code.
