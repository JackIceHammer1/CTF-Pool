My friend Connor locked himself out of his linux system. He sent me a copy of his disk drive, and wants me to find his password for him, but I can't seem to figure it out. Please help me!

The flag is the password; Ex: lbctf{password}

HINT: Use "gzip -d" to unzip the disk image file.
HINT: My friend JOHN said he might be able to help...
