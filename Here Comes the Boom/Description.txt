The Indian Space Research Organization misplaced the date of their launch of Soyuz T-11. This is highly important to the historian of the ISRO, as it help with record keeping, the historian needs the date of the day before the launch so that way he can use it as a reference point. After you do this, call over Nathan Porter and run one lap around the lower track, if you do so in under 1 minute, he will then tell you what to do from there.
