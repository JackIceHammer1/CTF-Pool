1. Steganography Tools Analysis:
   - Steghide: Robust tool for hiding data within images and audio files. Supports various encryption methods.
   - OpenStego: Offers a simple GUI and supports random LSB. Limited to PNG and BMP.
   - StegCracker: Useful for brute-forcing the passwords of Steghide-embedded files.

2. File Corruption and Repair:
   - JPEGs often start with FF D8 FF. Corruption can prevent images from being displayed properly.
   - Tools like JPEG Repair Ninja can be used to repair headers and recover images.

3. Encryption and Decryption Techniques:
   - AES and RSA are commonly used, but custom encryption can be harder to crack.
   - Keys might be hidden within the file's metadata or other obscure locations.

Conclusion:
Steganography combined with encryption makes detecting and extracting hidden data challenging. A thorough analysis of file structures and metadata is crucial for any digital forensic investigation.
