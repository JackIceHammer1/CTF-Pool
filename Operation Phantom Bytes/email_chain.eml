Lead,

I've run the 'compromised_evidence.jpg' through our standard recovery tools but hit a wall. I suspect Phantom has used a dual-layer of protection here, likely steganography and encryption. I recall them mentioning 'StegCracker' last week. Maybe that's worth a shot? Or perhaps it's a red herring...

Good work, J.

Proceed with caution. Phantom is known for misleading tactics. Double-check the logs for any unusual activity or tools used. And keep an eye out for any hidden partitions or files. We can't afford any oversights.
