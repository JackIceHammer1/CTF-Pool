The program takes an input and turns it into binary, using the length of the input to determine the number of bits for each number.
The binary flag is 220 bits long.
The offset_generate() function selects the number of bits

For 10, it assigns 6
For 11, it assigns 5
For 20, it assigns 11
The check_offset() function ensures that the number has no remainder.
This process leaves only a few possible numbers to decode the binary."

I wrote this python to decode it 

def binary_to_text(binary_string, length):
    text = ""
    for i in range(0, len(binary_string),length):
        binary_char = binary_string[i:i+length]
        decimal_value = int(binary_char, 2)
        text += chr(decimal_value)
    print(text)
    return text

x="0000110110000001100010000011000110000111010000001100110000011110110000110001000000110001000011011100000011000000001110010000011110010000101111100000110001000011100110000101111100001100110000001110000000110111000001111101"
for i in range(1,15):
	binary_to_text(x, i)
