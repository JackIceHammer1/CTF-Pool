Use steghide (guaranteed) or some other stego tool (not tested) to extract data from the image, which will provide a base64 string. Decrypt that string, resulting in a hexadecimal string that ends in /w4/s1/v2. This is a Library of Babel coordinate. Go to libraryofbabel.info/browse.cgi and paste in the hex, not including /w4/s1/v2. Once in that room, go to wall 4, shelf 1, volume 2, and enclose the title in lbctf{} brackets.
