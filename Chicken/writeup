The Description really gives the user no information, except for the fact that "I" love flightless birds.
The chicken.pdf is an absolute red herring, which gives no value information except for that fact that I found
that pdf online while "researching." However, the other text file called ilovebirds.txt has a less amount of 
chicken words, and this can be interpreted as a well known esoteric programming language, which wikipedia 
defines as, "a programming language designed to test the boudaries of computer programming language design, 
as a prood of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another langue, or as a joke." In this case,
the chicken programming language is a joke. When someone looks up "chicken programming language," the first link 
is: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Chicken which when they scroll down the page will see that the same amount of chicken
words corresponds to the word "Cat." Wrap that bad boy in lbctf{} and call it a day.

ANSWER: lbctf{Cat}
