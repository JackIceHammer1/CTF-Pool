theres 2 ways to do this
1: you can write out each hanzi character and if google translate works, it will give you "can of worms"

2: put it into a steganography website
   youll get a bunch of ciphers, but only two of them are actual ciphers
   one is base64 and one is rot47
   base64: Y2FuX29mXw== -> can_of_
   rot47: H@C>D -> worms
lbctf{can_of_worms}
