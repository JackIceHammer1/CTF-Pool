Problem for the page:

Help! I need to get into my friend's apartment because I left my Xbox controller in there.
The room unlocks with the right code.
Danny sent me a picture of himself with the code, but I can't seem to open it.
Can you help?

Hint: Why is this apartment building's elevator missing a number?
