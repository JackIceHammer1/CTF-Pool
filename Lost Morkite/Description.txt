Management wont get off of our backs. We went into a mission *a little* tipsy, and we lost the Morkite deposit 
on the way back to the drop pod. Can't he understand that we were sincerely trying our best? Just because we lost the 
Morkite doesn't mean that the recovery should be handed off to a greenbeard like you! Maybe if you recover the haul, 
we'll buy you a drink at the Abyss Bar.

All management gave us to work with was this. He gave us a whole sheet about it, but we only picked out some music term 
about texture. Best figure it out, recruit!

New development, recruit! Another team recovred the M.U.L.E that our Morkite was stored in. However, it doesn't seem to
be opening, and is asking for a password. I think I remember the sheet that management gave us saying that it was some
kind of admin password, maybe we could use it to open the M.U.L.E!
