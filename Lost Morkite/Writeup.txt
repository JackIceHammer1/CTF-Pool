The opening paragraph is exposition.
The first cipher is a Homophonic Cipher, as hinted at by "some music term about texture," which if you are to google that

After decoding the cipher, you will get the password: "ROCKANDSTONE3", which you are told to input into the M.U.L.E.

This step is steganography, with ROCKANDSTONE3 being the password. The appropriate image to use this password for
is Molly.jpg. Once you decrypt the message, you will get:

	We should have known, those pointy-eared leaf lovers stole our Morkite!
	All they left was this:
	.-.. . .- ..-. .-.. --- ...- . .-. ... ....- . ...- .- ....
	Crack it, tell us what it is, and we'll get you your drink. Management 
	can handle the loss.

This is morse code, which when translated, gives you "LEAFLOVERS4EVAH" which is the password for another stego, this one 
on the Glyphid Slammer.jpg image. After decoding, you will get the flag, which is:
