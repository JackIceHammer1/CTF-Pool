This is fun one.

So you start with: "ZJATXLNBPXZNBPXZNBBEZNCP"
this is a rozier cipher, which you need a key and an alphabet
the key is: "HELLO" which you get from the qr code
the alphabet is in the imagem which is pokemon unown language
alpabet is "MGBYQJPFVZCUDKTHILXWSOENAR"

decrypting the rozier will get you: "BCACACBBBABBBBABBBABBBCB"
this is a triliteral cipher

decrypting that will get you: "punemneq"
this is rot-13, which will decrypting into the flag "charzard"
